TASK 1
Using a data unification algorithm, the tech team at our client, Daikibo, has converted all telemetry data collected from its 4 factories:

Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 mins. Daikibo has been collecting this data for one month (May 2021) and they've shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.

The reason the client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

In which location did machines break the most?
What are the machines that broke most often in that location?


ANSWERS
Q1: In which location did machines break the most?
Look at Sheet 1 (Factory Chart). The factory with the highest "unhealthy" count (failures) is the one where machines broke the most.
📌 From MY dashboard, it appears "Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)" has the highest failures.


Q2: What are the machines that broke most often in that location?
Filter Sheet 2 (Device Type Chart) for only the highest-failure factory (Daikibo Factory Seiko).
Identify the machine type with the highest "unhealthy" count.
📌 From My chart, it appears the "Laser" machine had the most failures.
